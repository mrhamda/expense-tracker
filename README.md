# Abdullah Hamdan â€“ Expense Tracker

The focus was here was to showcase being able to use VUE and Nosql databases while also encrytping without spending any time on design.

The app is about creating accounts and login in authenication system fully hand made without firebase just with pure mongodb. The important stuff like password are encrytpted. The forgot password is also implemnted where when you want to reset password, a token is sent to your gmail so that you can reset the password and then the user gets another reset token that's not like before. It is about managing your expensese what you gain and what you spend. You can put the amount and the title and then deleting it.

As I said the focus is showcasing tehcnology so I did not focus a lot on design neither that much on functionailty and the general app idea.
